### Requirement Analysis 
VDAATEXPRESS is an online shopping mall which allows people to sell and purchase 
different items. This system is very beneficial for its clients because it provides ability to buy 
and purchase various items for the user according to their preferences. This system will help 
to save clientâ€™s time and get several items at any time in one place.
When clients are using our web site, they can search for items and get the items information. 
If they want to buy or purchase items they should register as a customer or a seller to the 
system.
Initially, to get the service from this system clients should register for the system providing 
clientâ€™s name, password, phone number, date of birth, email, and gender and after they have 
registered to the system, they have given a user ID. If they are already registered, they can log 
into the system by providing their username and the password. And every user can update 
user login details.
After registering to the system, the clients can place orders and buy items online according to 
their wish. These all items have item code, price and an item description and each order has 
an order ID, order date and a description. They can add and remove product items and change 
quantity in their shopping cart. If a seller is adding items or advertisements for the system, 
they should get permission from the system admin who will provide facilitate to add items 
and publish advertisements on the website. The system will provide an invoice for all these 
actions. After all the system admin will create a report on all the money transactions.
When it meets the payments, the system will provide the payment abilities via credit card and 
debit card payment methods. The users should enter their bank type, payment type and credit 
card number to make a successful payment.
To make it a better system the system should has user feedbacks. The feedbacks will be sent 
to the system admin to get an idea of the new requirements for the system. After that the 
admin will analyze the requirements add new items and functions to the system.
This system will give buyer and seller to fulfill their requirements in a convenient way than a 
manual system. The client can order item and get them at their place within a very short 
period of time
